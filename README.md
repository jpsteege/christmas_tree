# Christmas Tree

Small repository to create a chirstmas tree picture using Python and Turtle
This image is used for our personal christmas card

Want to explore the code by yourself? Please follow these steps:

### Get Python and Jupyter up and running
1. Install Python to you personal computer. A simple start is using Miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), you should select here a Python 3.x version.
2. If Miniconda is installed, open the editor that comes with it. If you added the installation to your path, you can use the standard code editors on your machine. For Windows this is PowerShell, for Mac this is Terminal. You can check if conda is installed correctly: in the editore '(base)' should be the prefix of the row.
3. With the editor open, install Jupyter Lab, to easy read an write code in your browser in so called 'notebooks'. You can do this by typing the command: <br>
   `conda install jupyter-lab` 
4. Jupyter must recognize your python instance. Therefore, type the following command: <br>
   `ipython kernel install --name 'Python 3 (Conda)' --user`

### Download the code
4. Download the code of this repository. In the upper right corner of this screen, click on the green 'Code'-button and then select 'Download ZIP'. <br>
   Once downloaded, extract the ZIP-file
5. Find the system path of the just downloaded folder, which you can find using Windows Explorer or Mac Finder.
6. In the text editor go to the folder you just downloaded. This can be done by typing the following command: <br>
   `cd '<path>'` <br>
   You know should notice that the path you just entered is visible in the code editor

### Start up
7. Now start Jupyter using the following command: <br>
   `jupyter lab` <br>
   A browser link becomes visible, which you can open.
8. Open the notebook (file that ends with .ipynb). You now can see and run the code cells.
